# Environment variables

**All files within `./env` folder should be copied to `../kobo-env`.** 
They are only templates and must be modified to fit your needs.


Paths in composer files `../docker-compose.*.yml` are set to use this path.
If you want to use another path, be sure to update composer files.
 

For information on the Docker Compose environment files,
see: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#envfile](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#envfile).
